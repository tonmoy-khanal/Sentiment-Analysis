This project is to build a machine learning model that predicts the sentiment of a movie review. Sentiment analysis is an NLP technique used to determine whether data is positive, negative, or neutral. Itâ€™s really helpful for businesses because it helps understand the overall opinions of their customers. For this project, you will use an IMDB dataset that contains 50k movie reviews. with 2 columns (review and sentiment). The goal is to build the best machine learning model that predicts the sentiment given a movie review. To make this project beginner friendly you only have to predict whether a movie review is positive or negative. This is known as binary text classification because there are only two possible outcomes.
